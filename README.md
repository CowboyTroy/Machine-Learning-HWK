The Easy Ensemble Classifier had the best balanced accuracy score (~0.93 > ~0.78), the best recall score (0.94 > 0.87), and the best geometric mean score (0.93 > 0.78)
The top three features were:
(1) total_rec_prncp: (0.07876809003486353) (2) total_pymnt: (0.05883806887524815) (3) total_pymnt_inv: (0.05625613759225244)

In the resampling exercise, the Sampling Model had the best balanced accuracy score of 0.9934649587814939. The SMOTE, Undersampling, and Oversampling had the equivalent recall scores of 0.99, and all models but the simple regression had geometric mean scores of 0.99.
